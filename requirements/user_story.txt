User Story: Payer Strategy Workflow

Description:
The virtual deal desk is a tool that will support the capture of brand strategies and expedite a response to an opportunity brought forth from the field. This epic is focused on the first area of functionality.
The virtual deal desk will provide tools to help the PCD team and other strategy-oriented colleagues create, edit, publish, and review brand strategies in each of three strategy segments; namely, payer, provider, and channel partner spaces. This epic is concerned with the development of the business logic, user experience, and scoping the functionality of the system related to managing brand segment strategies

As a Pricing, Contracting, and Distribution (PCD) user,
I need a dynamic interface to define price protection policy and Brand Segment strategies in the Payer space,
so that I can accurately capture varying max concession rate requirements.
